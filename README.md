# Smart Mowing Machine Project

The goal of this project was to design a "smart lawn mower" for a company named A.W.B Schots N.V..

This project included the design of custom PCBs to be placed on an industrial lawn mower. These PCBs were connected with arduino modules that communicated over a bus protocol. One master arduino module was resposible for storing data and pushing data to the operator's phone. The data was then pushed to the cloud (Microsoft Azure) and visualised usign Power BI. The gathered data was used to help the company analyse the operator's efficiency and help the company save money by characterizing the difficulty of different lawn mowing routes.

This GitHub repository holds all Arduino resources used for our EE5 Project.
The code for the Android application is kept in a different repository here:
https://github.com/NathanHerrebosch/AWB_App.git

Please also note the Documents folder where additional documentation can be found for testing/implementing our project.
