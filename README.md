# EE5: Smart Mowing Machine Project
This is our updated repository!

This GitHub repository holds all Arduino resources used for our EE5 Project.
The code for the Android application is kept in a different repository here:
https://github.com/NathanHerrebosch/AWB_App.git

A general overview of used hardware and software can be found on our openproject wiki.

Please also note the Documents folder where additional documentation can be found for testing/implementing our project.
